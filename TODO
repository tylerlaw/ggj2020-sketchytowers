For Later:
- if a player dies, the minigames need to exit
- if a player takes damage while in a minigame, the game should exit or show a dmg overlay







- finish lobby experience
	- start button
	- count down

- map

- also could build this with my original 2 interface idea

Main Screen:
- shows the full map

Smartphone:
- a player's controller
- smartphone users look at the main screen to play

iPad:
- the "commander's" ui
- shows the fullmap and ui to build towers



Server side will need the makeup of the level
- needs to be able to run Physics
- doesn't need all of the textures and all that shit, er wait actually it will because its the screen



GAME
- Map
- Character running around
- Physics

AIRCONSOL
- Synced player positions

ENGINE
- ScreenManager
- Storage
- Analaytics support
- FPS meter
- BMP movie clip sprite

SPLASH
- Simple html splash and load bar would be fine
